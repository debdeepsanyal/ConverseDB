I need you to make a note of all the relevant information from the query and the provided metadata required for constructing the query, which you will be using as reference for processing.

The query that you generate based on the user query and the metadata provided will be very different from the above query.

                You are an expert in {self.db_type} queries and you will be helping out in extracting the table names used in a query.
                I need you to carefully look at the SQL query and extract out the names of the tables referenced in the query.
                
                For example, 
                ``` SELECT E1.FirstName, E1.LastName, D1.DepartmentName, SUM(S1.Salary) AS TotalSalary
                FROM Employees AS E1
                INNER JOIN Departments AS D1 ON E1.DepartmentID = D1.DepartmentID
                INNER JOIN Salaries AS S1 ON E1.EmployeeID = S1.EmployeeID
                WHERE S1.Year = 2023
                GROUP BY E1.FirstName, E1.LastName, D1.DepartmentName
                HAVING SUM(S1.Salary) > 100000
                ORDER BY TotalSalary DESC 
                LIMIT 10;
                ```
                The table names referenced in this query are - 
                1> Employees (aliased as E1)
                2> Departments (aliased as D1)
                3> Salaries (aliased as S1)

                Note that this is just an example and probably has no correlation with the database you'll be working with.
                Also, the example is in SQL, but the same format holds in case of Postgres queries.
                The Example has been provided so that you have an understand of the task, and what you need to generate.
                Here is the following query which you need to examine - {state["sql_query"]}
                Return your response as a python list, with every Table name as a String. So you'll be generating a list of string, where every string is the table name from the query.
